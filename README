# Sentiment Analysis on Tweets: Classical Machine Learning vs Transformer (RoBERTa)
This project implements a comprehensive Sentiment Analysis system that compares the performance and accuracy of classical machine learning models and a transformer-based model (RoBERTa) using Twitter text data.
It is developed as an interactive Streamlit web application, allowing users to visualize the preprocessing steps, model evaluations and review deep-learning explainability through gradients, attention heads and hidden state visualizations.

### Abstract
The objective of this project is so design, train and evaluate various sentiment classification models capable of determining whether a tweet is positive, neutral or negative.
The project integrates both traditional ML pieplines (TF-IDF + Scikit-Learn models) and state-of-the-art transformer architecture for comparisons.
